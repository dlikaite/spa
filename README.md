# Spa Website for Ausra Spa Namai (html version)

For the final project at Vilnius Coding School's Web Development Course I chose to create a Homepage for "Ausra Spa Namai" based on the design of template they have bought.

It's worth noting that for the Image Slider I am using Owl Caroussel plugin.
